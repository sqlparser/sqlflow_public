# Git Commit Message Style Guide

When writing commit messages, follow these seven rules:

1.  Separate subject from body with a blank line
2.  Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3.  Capitalize the subject line
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period
5.  Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6.  Wrap the body at 72 characters
7.  Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
