This article gives you a basic idea about the main elements in a data lineage result generated by the Gudu SQLFlow in the JSON/XML format.

For more detailed explanation about the elements used in a data lineage result, please check the data lineage structure reference after reading this article.

## 1. Sample SQL

We use a simple Oracle SQL query to demostrate the data lineage analysis result.

```sql
INSERT INTO deptsal
            (dept_no,
             dept_name,
             salary)
SELECT d.deptno,
       d.dname,
       SUM(e.sal + Nvl(e.comm, 0)) AS sal
FROM   dept d
       left join (SELECT *
                  FROM   emp
                  WHERE  hiredate > DATE '1980-01-01') e
              ON e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP  BY d.deptno,
          d.dname; 
```

## 3. JSON output of this data lineage

## Main elements in the result

### 3.1 Database objects, JSON path: $.dbobjs

All database objects discovered during the data lineage analysis are stored in the `$.dbobjs` object.

#### Table

In the above sample SQL, there are four tables founded:

- DEPTSAL
  you can use `$.dbobjs[1].name` to return the table name, and `$.dbobjs[1].type` to return the type of this object which is `table` in this case.
  you can also use expression like this to get this table:
  ```
  $.dbobjs[?(@.name=='deptsal')].name
  ```
- DEPT
  ```
  $.dbobjs[?(@.name=='dept')].name
  ```
- EMP
  ```json
  $.dbobjs[?(@.name=='emp')].name
  ```
- SQL_CONSTANTS
  This is not a real table, but a table generated by the Gudu SQLFlow to store the constant used in the SQL query.
  ```json
  $.dbobjs[?(@.name=='SQL_CONSTANTS')].name
  ```

### 3.2 Relation, JSON path: $.relations

Relation is the atom unit of the data lineage. Relation build a link between the source and target column( column-level lineage).

Those relations are stored in the `$.relations`.

A relation includes the `type`, `target`, `sources` and other attributes.

- type
  There are 2 types of relation between source and target column.
  a) Direct dataflow: represented by the `fdd` in the JSON output.
  b) In-direct dataflow: represented by the `fdr` in the JSON output. In-direct dataflow also known as `impact` type, which means the value of the source column doesn't affect the value of the target column, but effect the rows number of the target column. For instance, the relation between a source column in the where clause and  the column in the select list is a In-direct relation(impact).
- target
  This is the target column.
- sources
  These are source columns where the data of the target column comes from.

#### Return a relation which target column is dept_no

```json
$.relations[?(@.target.column=='dept_no')]
```

### 3.3 Connect relations to form a dataflow

Let's say you want to trace back from `DEPTSAL.dept_no` to `DEPT.deptno` in the above diagram.

- Discover the relation 1 using the following JSON path
  ```json
  $.relations[?(@.target.column=='dept_no')]
  ```
- Discover the relation 2 using the following JSON path
  ```json
  $.relations[?(@.target.column=='deptno')]
  ```
