## Data lineage in 3 steps: Search, Select and Visualize

Sometimes, it's not easy to find the data flow of a specific table or column
in a giant map of the enterprise's data lineage.

Since the SQLFlow frontend version 2.1.9, it is never so easy to find 
the table and column in the schema explorer.

Just enter the name of a table or column. The SQLFlow will highlight the founded 
table or column automatically in the schema explorer, then select and visualize 
the table or column with a right mouse click.
SQLFlow will display the data lineage of the selected table or column instantly.
